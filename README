This game is called Badass. It is a top-down action-adventure game.
Its upgrade paths involve facial hair. You start with no facial hair at all,
progress to a basic mustache, and later through a series of decisions,
and end up with a very badass beard.

Your hairstyle determines your powers. If you have a well-established
style, like Zeus or a kung fu master, or Gimli, you might get lightning or
...kung fu, or an axe. You upgrade using some sort of tokens dropped by 
enemies that you destroy.
